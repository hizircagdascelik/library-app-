this code uses data structures to save and load data.
declared list variable contains books which are declared as dictionary.
by running main.py you can call addbook, update and search functions.
you can add new book
you can search books by name (don't need to write whole name of the book, sub-string is enough to find books which have that sub-string)
you can update books availibility status (to update you need to write exact name of the book)
list of books will be stored in harddrive, when ever you start the code you can load previus book list data.

additional features can be codded
1)delete book
2)adding new search options ( search by auther, availibility etc)
3)adding new properties/keys to book dict file (if someone borrows a book, borrowers name, return date, penalty etc)
4)update code should be updated to change the required properties/keys

this project can be coded by using RDBMS and OOD. Both data base management systems can be created by Python.
